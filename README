SCENARIOS

    This package supports the following scenarios:

 has

      package HasIdentity;
    
      use Data::Object::Role;
    
      has id => (
        is => 'ro'
      );
    
      package HasExample;
    
      use Moo;
    
      with 'HasIdentity';
    
      package main;
    
      my $example = HasExample->new;

    This package supports the has keyword, which is used to declare role
    attributes, which can be accessed and assigned to using the built-in
    getter/setter or by the object constructor. See Moo for more
    information.

 requires

      package EntityRequires;
    
      use Data::Object::Role;
    
      requires 'execute';
    
      package RequiresExample;
    
      use Moo;
    
      with 'EntityRequires';
    
      sub execute {
    
        # does something ...
      }
    
      package main;
    
      my $example = RequiresExample->new;

    This package supports the requires keyword, which is used to declare
    methods which must exist in the consuming package. See Moo for more
    information.

      use Data::Object::Role;

      use Moo;
    
      with 'WithIdentity';
    
      package main;
